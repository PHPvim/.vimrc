# php.vimrc Contributing Guideline

## Principal
- Make pull requests which is not only suitable for personal.
- No non-english comments, any where or any reason.
- Maximum compatibility principle. Neovim, unix/linux/OS X 10+/macOS is the minimum requirements.
- New features' key mapping/binding, vim's default used key not allow!
